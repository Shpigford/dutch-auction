# Dutch Auction Platform

A Next.js-based Dutch auction platform originally built to sell [Optic](https://withoptic.com), a competitive monitoring and analysis platform. This project implements a fully automated Dutch auction system where the price decreases continuously over time until someone makes a purchase.

NOTE: This was originally thrown together very quickly for one specific purpose (selling Optic), so there's some cleanup to be done to repurpose it for your own use.

## Database Setup

The project uses Supabase for database management. The necessary migrations are included in the `supabase/migrations` directory. They will create the following tables:

- `sale_status`: Tracks the auction status and final sale price
- `email_notifications`: Stores user notification preferences
- `visitor_count`: Tracks unique visitors

## API Routes

- `/api/check-price-notifications`: Checks and sends price notifications
- `/api/create-checkout-session`: Creates Stripe checkout sessions
- `/api/subscribe-notification`: Handles notification subscriptions
- `/api/verify-payment`: Processes successful payments
- `/api/webhook`: Handles Stripe webhooks
